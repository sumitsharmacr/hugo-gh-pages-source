## Introduction

I am a postdoctoral research associate working on the MOCHA research project with Dr. Iain Bate and Prof. Alan Burns in the Real-Time Systems Research Group (RTSRG). The MOCHA project focuses on modelling, scheduling and allocation of complex many-core architectures that have high performance and stringent timing requirements. The project is targeted for the next-generation 5G communication stations. You can know more about MOCHA on the project website.

Before MOCHA, I worked on the H2020 DEIS project in 2018-2019 with Prof. Tim Kelly. The DEIS project involves model-based safety assurance (using OMG standard Structured Assurance Case Metamodel (SACM)) that is applicable to model-based autonomous and cyber-physical systems. This project was collaborated with AVL, Siemens, General Motor and Fraunhofer.

My research is mainly focus on real-time scheduling and real-time system design and anlysis with a focus on improving scheduling flexibility and adaptiveness. I also have produced work in timing predictability for next generation of systems including autonomous, robotic and cyber-physical systems to ensure safety, robustness and resilience.

## Biography

Xiaotian Dai is a research associate at the University of York, UK. He received a PhD degree from University of York in 2019 (with Best Thesis). He joined real-time systems group in 2015 as a PhD research student, supervised by Prof. Alan Burns. His PhD research involves cooperatively design of control system and real-time task scheduling for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where various flexible scheduling task models are proposed and implemented to investigate the scheduling impact on control performance. He received a M.Sc. in Control Systems from the University of Sheffield in 2014, and a B.Sc. in Automatic Control in 2011. He serves as a reviewer and a Program Committee member for many top real-time and design automation conferences.
